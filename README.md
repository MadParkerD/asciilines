## Purpose:
This program exists to convert .tvg files into ascii line drawings. For some reason this is not a bitmap. It is simultaneously the first assignment for the summer open source class tought by Bart.
This specific version of this program only supports vertical and horizontal lines. Valid .tvg files can be found in the test directory of this project if you need an example, but the tvg format used is otherwise dimensions on the first line, and all following lines define a single line of <character> <horizontal position> <vertical position> <v or v for horzontal/vertical> <length>
## Installation 
Run this program with python 3 like ```python3 canvas.py <name of file>```
